# 🛠️ Atelier

A personal space for technical practice, exploration, and creation.  
This is where études, experiments, micro-projects, and loose ideas coexist-without pressure for structure or completion.

## 📘 Purpose

- Eliminate friction when starting something technical.
- Embrace imperfection as part of the learning process.
- Build a practical, evolving reference for future use.
- Alternate between **new explorations** and **intentional revisits** of previously studied topics.

---

## ✅ Principles

- No requirement to “finish” a project.
- The same problem may be revisited in different languages or styles.
- **Repetition**, **rewrites**, and **deep dives** are valid learning tools.
- Some entries will be **reproducible and polished**; others will be **messy, fragmented, or throwaway** by design.
- Capturing notes, questions, and dead ends is as valuable as writing code.
